# MachineLearningProjects
This repo contains my coding assignments from my machine learning class at Brown.
Each homework assignment involves implementing a different ML algorithm.
Most of the implementation I did is under the TODO comments in the models.py file of each project.
The data was usually already preprocessed and cleaned.
